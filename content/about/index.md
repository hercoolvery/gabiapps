## Hello, I'm Hercoolvery of Gabi Apps.

For nearly 20 years, I've delved into the profound world of databases and system software, passionately dedicated to creating stable and efficient software. Exploring the intricate internals of complex technologies, understanding their structures, and designing better systems has always been a great joy for me.

Now, leveraging my extensive experience and technical depth, I am embarking on a new journey under the name **Gabi Apps** to introduce my own applications to the world. My goal is not just to provide functional apps, but to consistently release 'well-crafted' applications on the App Store that seamlessly integrate into users' daily lives and add significant value.

Gabi Apps pursues the following values:

*   **Robust Technology:** Building a solid foundation, even in unseen areas, to provide stability that users can always trust.
*   **User-Centric:** Believing that technology ultimately serves people, we evolve by listening to our users' voices.
*   **Continuous Growth:** We will not settle for what we've built, but will continuously grow through regular updates and new challenges.

This space is dedicated to documenting Gabi Apps' products, technology, and journey of growth. I look forward to connecting with you more through this platform.

**Join me and Gabi Apps on this exciting journey.**
