20 Years. A Legacy Forged in Semicolons and Sleepless Nights.

Now, I'm opening a new chapter with 'Vibe Coding'. This is an era where Intuition (The Vibe) becomes the language, transcending complex syntax. This new rhythm makes an old developer leap like a young coder experiencing the first rush of programming love.

Armed with deep technical insight and, admittedly, 'rusty yet occasionally useful ideas,' I charge forward like Don Quixote tilting at the windmills.

The apps and utilities I create are the evidence of this quest. I am not stuck in the past; I am writing a New Classic (Legacy) with new methods.
